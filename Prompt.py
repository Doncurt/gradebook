There are several diffrent ways in which i could have done this class, but I decided to challenge my self to keep as much processing( but no neccessarily showing prompts and such) of information with in the student and classrooms classes as possible, while only having the prompt class or modular questions. This doesnt mean it may the most elegant solution ever brough forth for this course

class Prompt(object):
    def printDepartment():
     print "Which one of these department are you looking for courses in?\n"
     print "\nCS\t\tEng\t\tMaths\n"

    def csClasses():
        print "The corrent offererings for CS classes are:\n "

    def engClasses():
        print "The corrent offererings for English classes are:\n "

    def mathsClasses():
        print "The current offerings for Maths are: \n'"
